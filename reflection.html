                    <p> Coming into this year, I had no experience with computer coding or digital writing.  Coding always seemed like some sort of magical language that only computer geniuses could use to create the websites that I used every day.  It really surprised me how easy it really was to code in html, once it was broken down into more manageable sections.  What I found most interesting and gratifying was seeing my work on a website using my new html address.  It was awesome to see my own work in something that I did not know much about pay off.  I found it very interesting to see how simple making a basic webpage is.  With a simple template, you can make a webpage using simple headings a paragraphs.  I liked learning the individual commands to create different pieces of my webpages.</p>
                    <p>I definitely thought that the hardest part of our first module on coding was all the linking.  I got most confused when we had to insert the links to pictures or link css projects.  Creating the individual pages was not very difficult when I could use my old works as references for the different types of commands and codes, but I never fully mastered the links.  It made it easier when I could use a template for my work because then I saw exactly where my links needed to go and how to code them.  All I had to do was add the new name to the page I was linking or the link to the image I was using.</p>
                    <p>My idea of what digital writing is has changed drastically over the first portion of this semester.  Coming into this class, I thought that we would be doing regular writing, in regular word documents and just submitting them online.  I did not realize that digital writing meant we would actually be creating digital content and structuring digital sites.  I have a lot more respect now for those who are experts at digital writing because it is so tedious.  I did not realize how literally every single symbol, image, or piece of graphic design has to be manually typed in using html code.  I thought that it could just be created similar to a Photoshop project, clicking and dragging content around the page to get the preferred design.</p>
                    <p>Overall, I am very glad that I learned these basic digital writing skills.  It is a unique talent that not many people in my field of study know how to do, so it should give me an extra leg up when I am searching for new jobs and internships in the future.  It all goes back to how studying the liberal arts at Virginia Tech actually gives us an advantage over many students at strictly liberal arts schools.  Studying at a technical school, we gain a technological advantage over those that will be competing with us for the same jobs someday.  It is a very valuable skill that I hope to better over the rest of this semester.</p>
