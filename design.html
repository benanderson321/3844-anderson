                    <h2>#3 T. Horizontal</h2>
                    <p>The first man on the roster is the point guard, number 3, the point guard, T. Horizontal.  He has the best technical skills on the team.  He has great fundamentals and very rarely makes skill related mistakes.  He has a great understanding of the game itself and sees the floor well.  He can remember plays and runs the floor.  Where he struggles is in his personal skills.  He sometimes sees the game as too technical, and does not always play as well with others.  He can be a bit of a ball hog, and many times only focuses on when his teammates mess up on the court.  Overall, he is a solid point guard with great technique, but just needs to improve his interpersonal skills.</p>
                    <h2>#11 T. Vertical</h2>
                    <p>The next man up is the shooting guard, #11, T. Vertical.  This is the man that everyone wants to be around.  He gets along will with everyone, and is the epitome of a people person.  He plays very good team basketball, and is never selfish.  Most importantly, he brings the team together.  When there are disputes, he is always the mediator, bringing peace to the team.  His downside is his technical play.  He does not have the most solid fundamentals, and turns the ball over frequently.  What he lacks in technical skill, he makes up for in his personal skills.</p>
