                    <h2>#3 T. Horizontal</h2>
                    <p>The first man on the roster is the point guard, number 3, the point guard, T. Horizontal.  He has the best technical skills on the team.  He has great fundamentals and very rarely makes skill related mistakes.  He has a great understanding of the game itself and sees the floor well.  He can remember plays and runs the floor.  Where he struggles is in his personal skills.  He sometimes sees the game as too technical, and does not always play as well with others.  He can be a bit of a ball hog, and many times only focuses on when his teammates mess up on the court.  Overall, he is a solid point guard with great technique, but just needs to improve his interpersonal skills.</p>
                    <h2>#11 T. Vertical</h2>
                    <p>The next man up is the shooting guard, #11, T. Vertical.  This is the man that everyone wants to be around.  He gets along will with everyone, and is the epitome of a people person.  He plays very good team basketball, and is never selfish.  Most importantly, he brings the team together.  When there are disputes, he is always the mediator, bringing peace to the team.  His downside is his technical play.  He does not have the most solid fundamentals, and turns the ball over frequently.  What he lacks in technical skill, he makes up for in his personal skills.</p>
                    <h2>#21 V. Left</h2>
                    <p>Next is the team's power forward, #21, V. Left.  Of anyone on the team, nobody spends more time in the film room than him.  He is constantly in the office studying film with the coaches and going over plays.  Nobody knows the playbook like he does or watches more film.  He always studies up on other teams' plays, strengths, and weaknesses.  His downside is his experience.  Because he spends so much time studying, he does not spend as much time practicing what he learns in the gym.  He knows all about different plays and skill moves, but he struggles to apply it.  If he could balance his head knowledge with practical experience, he could be an instant all-star.</p>
                    <h2>#28 V. Right</h2>
                    <p>The big man down low is the team's center, #28, V. Right.  You can't take this player out of the gym.  He is always our on the court learning perfecting his post moves.  He has a small arsenal of moves, but he can execute them to a tee.  His biggest weakness would be his lack of game knowledge, which comes from not enough time spent studying film.  Other teams sometimes find it easy to take advantage of him because he is very one-dimensional and does not study any new moves.  He also does not watch opponents' game film, so he never knows what to expect in games.  He needs to work on finding a balance to his quiet study and his practical work outside on the court.</p>
                    <h2>#30 V.T. Shaped</h2>
                    <p>The final man on the roster is the small forward, #30, V.T. Shaped.  He is by far the most valuable player to the team.  He embodies the best talents, skills, and assets of his teammates.  He has the technical skills and fundamentals of T. Horizontal, along with the interpersonal skills of T. Vertical.  With the balanced basketball and relational skills, he can run the floor and unite his teammates on and off the floor.  He also balances his study and practice.  He spends the right amount of time in the office, studying film and the playbook, but he also spends time in the gym, working on his skills.  With the balance between all these skills, he holds the team together.  All players should strive to have this holistic game.</p>
